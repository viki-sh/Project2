          <figcaption>BRIEF CAPTION HERE.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>A blue-red scale highlights both positive and negative changes, but visually favors increases with a positive blue tone.</li>
          <li>Fixed the range at [-50, 20], emphasizing positive changes and minimizing outlier declines.</li>
          <p>Deception Score : +1</p>
          <p>I gave this visualization a score of +1. Although I adjusted the color scale range to visually emphasize increases in abortion rates, the underlying trend, that most states experienced an increase, is accurate. My adjustment served to strengthen the visual argument in favor of the proposition without distorting the data itself. The decision helped make the positive trend clearer and more persuasive but remained within ethical bounds because no false information was introduced. </p>

        <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/bar.png" alt="">
          <figcaption>BRIEF CAPTION HERE.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Used a dark red tone to frame the negative, urgent burden.</li>
          <li>Selected only states where more than 20% of residents traveled out of state, focusing on extreme cases to strengthen the counterargument.  </li>
          <li>Reversed y-axis to prioritize and emphasize the most problematic states at the top for quick attention.</li>
          <li>Selected a title with impactful language, using terms like 'forced' and 'barriers to care' to emphasize the severity of access challenges.</li>
          <p>Deception Score : -1</p>
          <p>I gave this visualization a score of -0.5. I selectively filtered the data to only include states where more than 20% of residents traveled out of state for abortion care, which highlights the most severe cases and strengthens the counterargument against the proposition. While the underlying data is truthful, the filtering decision frames the situation as more widespread than it truly is across all states. This approach effectively supports a persuasive narrative while remaining ethically acceptable because the selective focus is based on real, significant barriers rather than fabricating new trends. </p>
