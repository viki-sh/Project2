      <h2>Proposition: Abortion Access is widespread in the United States</h2>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Adjusted the color scale range to [-50, 20] to emphasize increases in abortion rates.</strong><br>
            <em>Score: +1.5 </em><br>
            I adjusted the color range to make positive abortion rate changes visually stronger while still showing decreases. This helped the visualization feel more persuasive by making improvements seem more widespread. What worked well was that it made positive increases darker blue, even if the change was minimal. I considered using a symmetric color range but settled on this asymmetric range to better match the persuasive goal while keeping the data truthful.
            </li>
          
            <li><strong>Used a diverging blue-red color scale ('RdBu') to represent changes.</strong><br>
            <em>Score: +1 </em><br>
            The diverging color scale clearly separated increases and decreases, intuitively guiding the viewer's understanding. It helped the visualization feel balanced but persuasive toward positive outcomes. I considered using a single sequential color, but diverging colors better highlighted differences. The only drawback to this technique was that for the strongly decreased states, the dark red draws the viewers attention. 
            </li>
          
            <li><strong>Wrote a title and subtitle that frame the data positively.</strong><br>
            <em>Score: +0.5 </em><br>
            Choosing positive, confident wording in the title helped frame the visualization to emphasize improvement without exaggerating. It worked well to quickly set reader expectations in favor of the proposition. By saying "Almost All States," the title highlighted the large number of states with increased abortion rates, making the trend feel widespread and significant. I considered using a neutral title, but it would have been less effective in supporting the persuasive goal.

        <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/bar.png" alt="">
          <figcaption>Bar chart showing a large number of states where residents must travel to find abortion care.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Filtered to only states where more than 20% of residents traveled out of state.</strong><br>
            <em>Score: -1.5</em><br>
            I filtered the data to focus only on states with significant barriers, making access challenges seem more severe. This helped the visualization be persuasive by focusing attention on the worst cases. It worked well visually but removed broader context. I considered showing all states but decided a filter would better serve the counterargument.
            </li>
          
            <li><strong>Used a uniform dark red color for all bars.</strong><br>
            <em>Score: -0.5</em><br>
            The dark red color created an emotional framing of urgency and difficulty. It helped reinforce the sense of barriers persuasively. I briefly considered using a neutral palette but found red much more aligned with the emotional tone needed for the opposing argument.
            </li>
          
            <li><strong>Reversed the y-axis to show states with the highest barriers at the top.</strong><br>
            <em>Score: +1.5</em><br>
            Ordering the most extreme cases first helped focus viewer attention on the most important points. This made the visualization more persuasive and easier to read. I considered alphabetical ordering but found ranked ordering much more effective for the goal.
            </li>
          
            <li><strong>Selected a strong title with words like “forced” and “barriers to care.”</strong><br>
            <em>Score: -0.5</em><br>
            Using emotionally impactful language immediately set a tone of urgency and framed the issue as serious. It worked very well to create reader engagement. A more neutral title was considered but didn’t drive home the persuasive message as strongly.
          </li>

        <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

        <p>
            Creating the "for" proposition visualization was relatively easy because it aligned closely with the ground truth of the data. Simply adjusting scales and framing choices was enough to emphasize increases in abortion access persuasively. However, it was much more difficult to create the "against" proposition visualization because it went against the overall trend shown in the data. I had to be creative with selective filtering and careful emphasis to suggest access barriers while working with data that overwhelmingly pointed toward improved access. 
          </p>
          
          <p>
            What surprised me most was how much data I needed to discard or ignore in order to create a persuasive "against" argument. This showed me that truly deceptive visualization often requires not just reframing but also significant omission of inconvenient evidence. I now define ethical analysis and visualization as the practice of highlighting patterns in the data without altering their fundamental meaning. Persuasion becomes unethical when it crosses into misrepresentation, but strategic emphasis — if based on truthful data — can still be acceptable.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The bounds I draw between acceptable and misleading persuasive choices revolve around whether the visualization changes the underlying truth of the data. For example, flipping positive values to negative would be outright deception and unacceptable, as it directly lies about the data. In contrast, selectively choosing to ignore some truthful data points, while keeping the included data accurate and unmanipulated, can be ethically defensible. The key distinction lies in whether the visualization maintains the integrity of the information presented.
