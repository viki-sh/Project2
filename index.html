        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Adjusted the color scale range to [-50, 20] to emphasize increases in abortion rates.</strong><br>
            <em>Score: +1</em><br>
            Setting the color range emphasized small increases while minimizing large declines, visually strengthening the case that abortion access is widespread. A symmetric scale was considered but would have made increases appear less significant.
            </li>
          
            <li><strong>Used a diverging blue-red color scale ('RdBu') to represent changes.</strong><br>
            <em>Score: +1.5</em><br>
            A diverging color palette made positive and negative changes intuitively distinct, enhancing persuasive clarity without manipulating the actual data trends.
            </li>
          
            <li><strong>Wrote a title and subtitle that frame the data positively ("Abortion Access Expands...").</strong><br>
            <em>Score: +2</em><br>
            The title encourages readers to interpret increases as progress, making the argument persuasive without fabricating any claims. A neutral title was considered but lacked persuasive impact.
            </li>
          
            <li><strong>Set a clean white map background to minimize distraction.</strong><br>
            <em>Score: +2</em><br>
            The white background helped focus attention on the color scale, making changes across states more immediately visible and strengthening the impact without altering information.

        <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/bar.png" alt="">
          <figcaption>BRIEF CAPTION HERE.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Filtered to only states where more than 20% of residents traveled out of state.</strong><br>
            <em>Score: -1</em><br>
            Selectively focusing on the worst-affected states highlighted the severity of access problems, even though it hid the national average. It framed the issue as more widespread for persuasive effect.
            </li>
          
            <li><strong>Used a uniform dark red color for all bars.</strong><br>
            <em>Score: -0.5</em><br>
            The dark red color conveyed urgency and danger, enhancing the emotional weight of the barriers depicted without altering the underlying percentages.
            </li>
          
            <li><strong>Reversed the y-axis to show states with the highest barriers at the top.</strong><br>
            <em>Score: +1.5</em><br>
            Prioritizing the most extreme cases first immediately drew attention to the strongest examples of access barriers, helping make the visualization more persuasive and impactful.
            </li>
          
            <li><strong>Selected a strong title with words like “forced” and “barriers to care.”</strong><br>
            <em>Score: -0.5</em><br>
            Emotional language framed the travel burden as more severe, strengthening the persuasive effect without altering the true data story.
