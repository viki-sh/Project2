        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Adjusted the color scale range to [-50, 20] to emphasize increases in abortion rates.</strong><br>
            <em>Score: +1</em><br>
            Setting the color range emphasized small increases while minimizing large declines, visually strengthening the case that abortion access is widespread. A symmetric scale was considered but would have made increases appear less significant.
            </li>
          
            <li><strong>Used a diverging blue-red color scale ('RdBu') to represent changes.</strong><br>
            <em>Score: +1.5</em><br>
            A diverging color palette made positive and negative changes intuitively distinct, enhancing persuasive clarity without manipulating the actual data trends.
            </li>
          
            <li><strong>Wrote a title and subtitle that frame the data positively ("Abortion Access Expands...").</strong><br>
            <em>Score: +2</em><br>
            The title encourages readers to interpret increases as progress, making the argument persuasive without fabricating any claims. A neutral title was considered but lacked persuasive impact.
            </li>
          
            <li><strong>Set a clean white map background to minimize distraction.</strong><br>
            <em>Score: +2</em><br>
            The white background helped focus attention on the color scale, making changes across states more immediately visible and strengthening the impact without altering information.

        <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

          <img src="images/bar.png" alt="">
          <figcaption>BRIEF CAPTION HERE.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Filtered to only states where more than 20% of residents traveled out of state.</strong><br>
            <em>Score: -1</em><br>
            Selectively focusing on the worst-affected states highlighted the severity of access problems, even though it hid the national average. It framed the issue as more widespread for persuasive effect.
            </li>
          
            <li><strong>Used a uniform dark red color for all bars.</strong><br>
            <em>Score: -0.5</em><br>
            The dark red color conveyed urgency and danger, enhancing the emotional weight of the barriers depicted without altering the underlying percentages.
            </li>
          
            <li><strong>Reversed the y-axis to show states with the highest barriers at the top.</strong><br>
            <em>Score: +1.5</em><br>
            Prioritizing the most extreme cases first immediately drew attention to the strongest examples of access barriers, helping make the visualization more persuasive and impactful.
            </li>
          
            <li><strong>Selected a strong title with words like “forced” and “barriers to care.”</strong><br>
            <em>Score: -0.5</em><br>
            Emotional language framed the travel burden as more severe, strengthening the persuasive effect without altering the true data story.
            </li>

        <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

        <p>
            Creating the "for" proposition visualization was relatively easy because it aligned closely with the ground truth of the data. Simply adjusting scales and framing choices was enough to emphasize increases in abortion access persuasively. However, it was much more difficult to create the "against" proposition visualization because it went against the overall trend shown in the data. I had to be creative with selective filtering and careful emphasis to suggest access barriers while working with data that overwhelmingly pointed toward improved access. 
          </p>
          
          <p>
            What surprised me most was how much data I needed to discard or ignore in order to create a persuasive "against" argument. This showed me that truly deceptive visualization often requires not just reframing but also significant omission of inconvenient evidence. I now define ethical analysis and visualization as the practice of highlighting patterns in the data without altering their fundamental meaning. Persuasion becomes unethical when it crosses into misrepresentation, but strategic emphasis — if based on truthful data — can still be acceptable.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The bounds I draw between acceptable and misleading persuasive choices revolve around whether the visualization changes the underlying truth of the data. For example, flipping positive values to negative would be outright deception and unacceptable, as it directly lies about the data. In contrast, selectively choosing to ignore some truthful data points, while keeping the included data accurate and unmanipulated, can be ethically defensible. The key distinction lies in whether the visualization maintains the integrity of the information presented.
